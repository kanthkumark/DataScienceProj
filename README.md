# DataScienceProj
Image Recognition project for the Data Science Cohort

Idea is to create a csutomVision Prediciton end point that will recognize a Hog if present in a present.
This will be used for notifying the farmers when a hog is seen in their field.

I have used Custom Vision API provided by Azure.
Obtained images from the Google contianing Hogs and Manually tagged them
Used these tagged images for training the Model
Used the Prediction end point for feeding images and detecting objects
